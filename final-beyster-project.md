## Scope
If this brief seems wide, it's because it is!

There are some specifics [_("Constants")_](#constants) however, so start with those to get your bearings and let that be the leaping off point for the free-reign elements [_("Variables")_](#variables)!

### Constants 
> :question: _"non-negotiable specifics"_ \
> Elements of the project that are either completely set in stone or have clear constraints. \
> Embrace these because, as many people note, [Constraints can make you more Creative](https://buffer.com/resources/7-examples-of-how-creative-constraints-can-lead-to-amazing-work/)!

<summary><i>A daily stand-up (except Fridays & weekend)</i></summary>

- Times selected from trainer-provided options.
- Teams & trainers commit to:
    - holding stand-up at the same time each day of the project.
    - clearly communicating any absolutely essential absence from stand-up to all team members & trainers.
- At least one of your trainers will attend and share any important updates/feedback.
- Checkout [Agility's guide to daily stand-ups](https://agility.im/frequent-agile-question/what-is-a-daily-stand-up/) for a refresher/inspiration on how to run an effective stand-up.
- Your attending trainer **is not your Scrum Master**! Please facilitate these stand-ups yourselves!
- It's not required but most trainers usually like to be invited to join in so if time allows, do popcorn over to them as well!

- Then edit to add the teams feedback into the four quadrants. 
- The project manager will need to show this to the trainer for a reflection on the notes.
- **Note: This feedback needs to collected about the dynamic of the team. Individual feedback is mostly discussed in a Sprint Review**

<summary>Presentation Preparation</summary>

Each team will have 2 'dry runs' before the final 'demo day' event. Please read these preparation guidelines:

<table>
<tr>

<td><details>
<summary>For both dry runs...</summary>

- Team time slots will be assigned and shared at least one day in advance.
- Please be ready in the waiting room a bit before your assigned time and we will let you in as soon as we are ready.
- Be prepared to give your presentation at whatever stage it is at. _(See the specific preparation requirements below)_
- Your trainers will attend and facilitate.
- All Academy staff are invited to drop in as their schedule allows though, so don't be surprised if other faces appear/disappear! 
- Honest feedback on presentation content & delivery will be given by trainers and other attending staff.
- If you drastically run over the 10-12 minute time guide, we will need to stop and give feedback based on the content we have seen up until that point.
- **These are not technical Q&A or debug sessions!**

</details></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><details>
<summary><i>1st Dry Run (Week 2 Thursday AM)</i></summary>

- Preparation Requirements:
	- Presentation outline _(order of content & speakers)_
	- Your slide deck _(it's okay if a few details are missing/undecided at this point)_
	- A rough draft of your demo video 
		- _We all know this is going to get re-recorded, probably several times._
		- _Nobody will be worrying that your product/service looks ugly/is unfinished/is broken at this point._
		- _The important thing is to have a video file to play, with key visual moments, to practice reading your voiceover - it's not as easy as it might sound!_
- A member of your team will run the slide deck.
- Aim to run the timings & handovers as planned, even if the content is not yet complete.
- Any required or suggested changes will be given by trainers.

</details></td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td><details>
<summary><i>2nd Dry Run/Final Rehearsal (Week 2 Friday AM)</i></summary>

- Preparation Requirements:
	- Materials to be shared with trainers at least 1 hour in advance: 
		- Slide deck
		- Cue sheet
		- Demo recording _(Please provide separately, even if you have embedded it into your deck)_
	- _NB: Materials should be submitted as complete. Small adjustments can be made after 2nd dry run but we aim to keep them to a minimum!)_
- An Academy staff member will share their screen and run the slide deck. _(Likely one of your trainers)_
	- This is their rehearsal as well as yours so make sure you practice giving the cues that are in your cue sheet!
- Run the presentation as if in the 'real thing'.
	- That means professional delivery mode - if you wouldn't do it when presenting to a client, don't do it in your dry run!
	- The Academy staff member running the deck may pause to clarify a significantly problematic cue or technical requirement but will aim to follow you through any mishaps and save questions/clarifications for after the run.

<summary>Demo Day Event (Presentations!)</summary>

This project's presentations will be delivered as the main event in your cohort's Demo Day! The demo day is an opportunity for you and your trainers to celebrate and share your amazing progress! 

<table>

<tr>
<td><details>
<summary>People Involved</summary>

These events are hosted by a senior member of Academy staff - there's a slight chance that the host will be someone you've not had as much chance to get to know yet. They always aim to come to the rehearsals and I promise we're all very friendly and inordinately proud of you even if you don't know it yet!

These events are open to clients and all Academy staff so you **_might_** see
- A larger audience than previous presentations
- New faces and names
- Some familiar and unfamiliar company names

</details></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><details>
<summary>Sample running order</summary>

The running order will be confirmed by your trainers in advance but an **example** running order for an event with 3 presenting teams could look like:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 2.30pm | All teams & trainers gather in event room link |
| 2.35pm | Tech check _(your mics & cameras, host's mic & camera, slide deck screen share, any other media)_ |
| 2.50pm | Pre-game wiggle/breathe/bathroom! |
| 3.00pm | Room opened to public |
| 3.03pm | Host: Welcome & housekeeping |
| 3.05pm | Host: Course overview & cohort introduction |
| 3.10pm | Team 1: Presentation |
| 3.25pm | Team 1: Q&A _(moderated by host)_ |
| 3.30pm | Team 2: Presentation |
| 3.45pm | Team 2: Q&A _(moderated by host)_ |
| 3.50pm | Team 3: Presentation |
| 4.05pm | Team 3: Q&A _(moderated by host)_ |
| 4.15pm | Host: Wrap up |
| 4.20pm | END |

**NOTE** This is likely to change regarding to delivery of final presentations in Farnborough.

<td><details>
<summary>Business Case</summary>

Coming up with an idea is hard! As humans we're pretty good at finding problems though :wink: so let's use that to our advantage!

If you already have a problem you'd like to work on, please do go for it!
For those that are less inclined to have problems on the mind _(I approve of your outlook!)_, here are some overall themes _(and example problem statements)_ that might get your brains whirring!
- "Social justice through technology"
- "Creative learning experiences"
- "Life on Earth... and beyond!"
- "Tech to destress"

Remember, your Business Case will need to be supported by a range of appendices to back up your problem and solution. You can draw on as many of these as you wish. We would suggest:

- Stakeholder and Risk Analysis
- Decision Matrix
- Data Analysis
- Process / Data Flow Diagrams (if relevant)

</details></td>
</tr>


<tr>
<td><details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

You've already experienced outlining, analysing & selecting a solution so we're fully on board with you to take this one from here!

See [Requirements & Guidelines > Technical Guidelines](#requirements--guidelines) for some points to bear in mind

</details></td>
</tr>


<tr>

<td><details>
<summary>MVP</summary>

Your MVP will need to include:
- An API 
- A database
- A frontend application

You are welcome to implement the use of new tools such as **AI**.

_The below is a **suggested** outline of how tasks should be divided across the members of your team and their specialisations_

| Specialism | Tasks |
| -- | -- | 
| CDO | Implement API + Containerisation + Microservices + S3 Bucket Reporting + Lead Developer Backend |
| Change | Implement Business Case + Lead Project using Agile + Supporting developer Frontend |
| Data | Support PM in Business Case + Implement Database + Connection to API + Data Cycle (S3 Bucket?) + Supporting Developer Backend |
| SED | Implementation of CDD + Testing + Lead Developer Frontend |

_Cross collaboration in this project is vital and the ability to quickly understand the specialisms that the members of your team can bring to the project will be of significant benefit._

See [Requirements & Guidelines > Technical Guidelines](#requirements--guidelines) for some points to bear in mind.
